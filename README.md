# MonteCarloRecursiveRaytracer
Files for coursework 2 of the Fundementals of Modelling and Rendering master's module. Involves creating a bespoke, pure C++, Monte Carlo Raytracer for generating an image based on a .scene file

RaytraceRenderWidget.cpp- this is the bespoke file responsible for raytracer logic developed by myself, all other files were provided by the module leader
